* <details><summary>Troubleshooting Crashes</summary>

	> Try the following steps to reduce the probability of server crash

	1. If you are local server (listen server), please get a dedicated server
		* [Sourcemod does not support listen server](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Installing_SourceMod_(simple)#Your_Server), can't hold too many mods and plugins

	2. [Update Sourcemod Stable Version](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=stable)
		<br/>![image](image/43.jpg)

	3. [Update Metamod Stable Version](https://www.metamodsource.net/downloads.php/?branch=stable)
		<br/>![image](image/44.jpg)

	4. Type ```sm plugins list``` to view all plugins
		* Find the original author or the link where you downloaded one by one, and update the plugin if newer version.
		* üü• Suggest not using plugins without source code, because if they are broken, there is no way to repair.
		* üü• More than ten years old plugins without any update and fix, please remove.
		
	5. Type ```sm exts list``` to view all extensions
		* Find the original author or the link where you downloaded one by one, and update the plugin if newer version.

	6. Check if any ```error_xxx.log``` in ```addons/sourcemod/logs``` folder
		* Please check the file and try to fix the errors it says.
		* Report the errors to the plugin author
		* üü• Must fix until no errors

	7. Try to remove plugins until figure out the reason
		* Remove half plugins -> test -> remove half plugins if crash -> test -> remove half plugins if crash -> repeatedly

	8. Try to remove mods or custom maps until figure out the reason
		* I don't recommend using .vpk mods in server.
		* Some weird mods or maps have custom vscript that could interfere the server.
		* Just as bad plugins cause poor performance and crashes, so do bad mods and bad maps.

	9. Let AI help analyze
		* Using ChatGPT Pro
		* AI may not be correct, but better than nothing
